SSH and SCP Clients for Windows Users

Hi everyone,

as we discussed in the lab this week, we encourage you to use a Linux operating system. However, it is not mandatory of course, so for those of you who have Windows installed on their computers you need an SSH client program to connect to our department's server dev.cs.hacettepe.edu.tr.

You may download PuTTy, and use the following settings to connect to dev:



You will also need to enter your ID (bxxxxxxx) and password when prompted:



Dev runs Linux, so you may want to try playing with the Linux Commands we covered this week and complete the lab exercise once you are logged in.

To be able to transfer your files you will also need a SCP/SFTP client. You may choose to download WinSCP, or some other similar program.

Again, use the same login info to connect:



Have fun learning new stuff and most importantly:



Go to https://piazza.com/class?cid=j8fu7k9jxaw7lo&nid=j805padu49776h&token=MChpgtco9XO to view. Search or link to this question with @14.  

Want Piazza in all your classes?  Tell your professors and TAs today.  It's free!

Thanks,
The Piazza Team
