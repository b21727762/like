Week 1 Lab Handout

Hi everyone,
=C2=A0
We are all very excited that the class has begun, and look forward to inter=
acting with you!



Here is the lab handout for this week: Using_Piazza_Course_Website_Grading.=
pdf

One important BBM103 grading policy that you need to keep in mind is that y=
ou must attend at least 80% of lab lectures in order to be eligible to pass=
 this course!
=C2=A0
We are aware that learning to program can be a challenging experience. Howe=
ver, your motivation, an early start, a lot of practice, patience, and Pyth=
on should make this process both fun and easy. Our advice to you is to star=
t learning today.
=C2=A0
We encourage you to research the topics covered in classes in greater depth=
. University education is not about memorizing things by heart, but rather =
about being pointed in the right direction, so that you can explore and lea=
rn on your own, and thus be prepared for the challenges of the real life.
=C2=A0
Please see the course web site for information about the assignments, quizz=
es, due dates, grading, and other course resources. Also, don't forget to c=
heck Piazza and course web site regularly for updates. We hope to develop a=
 community on Piazza where you can ask questions, discuss issues related to=
 the course topics and assignments, and help your classmates. But remember,=
 you are not allowed to post solutions or code. All work on assignments mus=
t be individual.
=C2=A0
Don=E2=80=99t hesitate to ask TAs for help, but before you do, make sure th=
at you have made an effort to solve the problem yourself.
=C2=A0
We are all very excited to get started!
=C2=A0
See you in class!
