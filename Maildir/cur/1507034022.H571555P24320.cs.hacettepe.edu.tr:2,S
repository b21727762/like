Python as an Embedded Language

Hi everyone,

click here to read an interesting article from this month's IEEE Spectrum magazine about a project in which Python is used as an embedded language. A PDF version of the article is available here: IEEE_Spectrum_Oct_2017-Embedded_Python.pdf.

This is not mandatory reading material, I just thought some of you may find this intriguing, especially those students who are interested in microcontroller based projects. It is nice to know that Python can be an alternative to conventional embedded development tools.

See you in lab!

Thanks,
