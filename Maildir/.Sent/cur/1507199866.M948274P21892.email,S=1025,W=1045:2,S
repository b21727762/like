lessons program by mistake.Some of my lessons are overlap.And I can't 
change it because of I accept to last state.So I need your help about 
this.And one more thing is BEB 650.I couldn't find this lesson in my 
program .Why I can't understand.One last thing I see a lesson ING111 but 
it isn't  seem in my program again.What can I do about it?And I tried to 
reach you about my problems at department. I hope you will answer my 
questions ,cancel my add-remove and be very happy if you make comeback.
